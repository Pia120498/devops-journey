“DevOps improves speed and reliability through automation, collaboration, and monitoring.”

Linux commands
Open a terminal (Linux / Mac / WSL).

1️⃣ Where am I?
pwd


Shows current directory.

2️⃣ What’s here?
ls
ls -l
ls -a


-l → long details

-a → hidden files

Think: containers, servers, cloud… all start here.

3️⃣ Move Around
cd /
cd ~
cd ..


DevOps engineers live in servers. Navigation is oxygen.

4️⃣ Create & Delete
mkdir devops
cd devops
touch day1.txt
rm day1.txt

Now create this again:

touch day1.txt

5️⃣ Read & Write Files
echo "My DevOps journey starts today" > day1.txt
cat day1.txt


> overwrites
>> appends


Part 3: Permissions (Very Important)

Check permissions:

ls -l


You’ll see something like:

-rw-r--r--


Breakdown:

r → read

w → write

x → execute

Change permission:

chmod 644 day1.txt

Interview gold:

“Linux permissions control access for user, group, and others.”

Part 4: Processes & System Awareness

Check running processes:

ps
top


Stop a process (concept only for now):

kill <pid>


DevOps monitors systems before users complain.

🧠 Part 5: How This Connects to DevOps

Everything you learned today is used in:

Docker containers

Kubernetes pods

CI/CD servers

Cloud VMs

If Linux is weak, DevOps collapses.
